# PCR Education Hub Web Application

This web application provides an interactive platform for learning about Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). It includes explanations of PCR principles, components, types, applications, troubleshooting, and a basic simulation of PCR amplification dynamics.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone/Download:**
    Place all the provided files (`app.py`, `generate_qpcr_plot.py`, `simulate_pcr.py`, `README.md`) into a root project directory (e.g., `pcr_webapp`). Create the `templates` subdirectory and place `pcr_app.html` inside it. The `static` directory will be created by the Python scripts if it doesn't exist, or you can create it manually.

2.  **Add Conceptual Images:**
    Create or source your own conceptual diagram images (e.g., `denaturation_diagram.png`, `annealing_diagram.png`, etc.). Place these image files directly into the `/static/` folder. The `pcr_app.html` file is already set up to reference these image names.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask matplotlib numpy
    ```

4.  **Generate Initial Data (Handled by Flask app):**
    The Flask application (`app.py`) is designed to automatically generate `q_pcr_curve.png` (the qPCR plot) and `pcr_simulation_data.json` in the `static` folder if they don't exist when the app starts or before the first request.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask Server:**
    From your project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Web App:**
    Open your web browser and go to:
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

    Your conceptual images should now appear in the relevant sections. If they don't, check:
    *   The image files are in the `static` folder.
    *   The filenames in the `static` folder exactly match those in the `<img>` tags within `pcr_app.html`.
    *   Your browser isn't caching an old version (try a hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).

## How it Works

*   **`app.py`**: A Flask application that serves the HTML pages and provides API endpoints.
    *   It renders `pcr_app.html`.
    *   It has an endpoint (`/get_simulation_data`) to provide PCR simulation results as JSON.
    *   It ensures that the necessary plot image (`q_pcr_curve.png`) and simulation data (`pcr_simulation_data.json`) are generated and placed in the `static` folder.
    *   Flask automatically serves any files (like your conceptual images, the generated plot, CSS, client-side JS) from the `static` folder.
*   **`pcr_app.html`**: The frontend of the application. It uses `url_for('static', filename='...')` to correctly link to images and other static assets. It uses JavaScript to fetch simulation data from the Flask backend and display it.
*   **`generate_qpcr_plot.py`**: Uses `matplotlib` to create a conceptual qPCR amplification curve and saves it as `q_pcr_curve.png` in the `static` directory.
*   **`simulate_pcr.py`**: Simulates basic PCR amplification and saves the results as `pcr_simulation_data.json` in the `static` directory.

## Further Development

*   **More Interactive Plots:** Use a JavaScript charting library like Chart.js (a placeholder is in `pcr_app.html`) to create dynamic charts from the simulation data.
*   **User Input for Simulation:** Allow users to input parameters (initial molecules, efficiency, cycles) for the PCR simulation.
*   **Advanced Styling:** Improve the visual appearance with more detailed CSS or a CSS framework.
*   **Database Integration:** For more complex data or user accounts.
*   **Deployment:** Deploy to a web server (e.g., Heroku, PythonAnywhere, AWS).
